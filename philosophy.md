Our program is designed as an open play environment whereby children learn and develop as a result of carefully selected activities and materials, including field trips. Our main goal is to have children develop an adequate self-concept in a school setting. We feel that what children are able to learn depends largely on their feelings about themselves.

The YCP has two classes; the “3’s Class” is for children who have turned three years old by December 1st, while the “4’s Class” is for children who have turned four years old by December 1st.

The three year old preschool class has a total of no more than 16 children. They meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9am to 12pm for a 34 week term.

The four year old preschool class has a total of no more than 20 children. They meet Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9am to 12pm for a 34 week term.

## Our Montessori environment

Inside the classroom children will:

- Flourish in a peaceful, calm, and purposeful setting designed to meet individual needs.
- Interact with classroosm supplies and materials that are strategically placed at their height for easy access.
- Find numerous places to learn and play and in many ways, such as: by themselves, in pairs, in small groups, in large groups, inside, outside, at tables, and on the floor.
Learn a sense of autonomy as they serve themselves snacks, wash their own dishes, and clean up their own spills and messes.
- Freely move throughout the classroom, choosing activities that interest them or work with the teacher, individually, or in small group.

## Curriculum

YCP offers a Montessori-based curriculum which offers your child the opportunity to learn and grow at his/her own pace in an environment meant just for children — a “prepared environment.” Your child will be offered many opportunities to learn using materials designed to teach specific concepts in the areas of practical life, sensory, math, language, culture, geography, science, and art.
