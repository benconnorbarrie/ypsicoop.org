## What is a Cooperative Preschool?

A Cooperative Preschool is a preschool where the parents participate fully in their child’s education. Parents are required to assist the teacher in the classroom, take on a job, attend Membership Meetings, and generally take an active role in their child’s preschool experience.

Time and energy are the main ingredients of a successful Co-op. But, the rewards definitely out-way the investments. Co-op parents learn from each other, support each other, and develop close and lasting friendships. And, Co-op students develop a sense of security in knowing that Mommy and Daddy will play active roles in their preschool experience while also developing lasting friendships along the way.

## What are the tuition and fees involved in becoming a member of the preschool?

Another advantage of a Cooperative Preschool is the low tuition and fees as compared with the traditional preschool. More information on current preschool tuition costs can be found in the Join section of our website.

## What are the parent responsibilities?

Parents will share in the responsibilities to help run the preschool and make it a successful time for their children. You can read more about the parent involvement in the Parents section of our website.

## What are the class schedules for the preschool?

The school year begins in September following Labor Day weekend and ends around the end of May. We follow the Ypsilanti Public School calendar, not including teacher work days and in-service days.

Most Co-op preschools offer a two or three day per week school schedule, with class time being three hours long. At Ypsilanti Cooperative Preschool the 3’s class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00am to 12:00pm and the 4’s class meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 9:00am to 12:00pm. For information about the daily class schedules, please see the classes page of the website.

## What kind of curriculum does the preschool offer?

Our preschool offers a Montessori-based curriculum. A Montessori curriculum offers your child the opportunity to learn and grow at his/her own pace in an environment meant just for children — otherwise known as a “prepared environment.” In the prepared environment your child will be offered many opportunities to learn using materials designed to teach specific concepts in the areas of practical life, sensorial (sensory), math, language, culture (geography), science, and art.

In addition to the Montessori subject areas listed above, your child will also have the opportunity to practice his/her gross motor skills on the indoor slide and monkey bars, participate in pretend play, use many different types of blocks for building, and participate in a circle time filled with stories, music and movement, calendar, weather, and theme related discussions.

The curriculum is typically based on a weekly theme and will include activities to go along with that theme in the following areas:

- Practical Life
- Sensorial
- Math
- Language
- Culture
- Science
- Art
- Music & Movement

## Who plans the curriculum and daily activities?

The teacher is responsible for planning the curriculum and daily activities. However, parents are always welcome to make suggestions about themes and activities for the classroom.
